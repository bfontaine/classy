# Classy

`classy` is a little tool written in Go to inspect Java `class` files.

This is a work in progress, and I use this project to learn Go so the code is
far from perfect. Feel free to open an issue if you think Iâ€™m doing something
wrong.

## Build

    make

## Usage

    ./classy <class file> [<class file> ...]


## TODO

* Write tests
